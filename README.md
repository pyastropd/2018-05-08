# Version Control: git&github (and SVN)

We organized this Python programming code talk in three parts:
1. Spicy introduction on version control 
2. How to use git with github (what's github?!)
3. Version control clients (if you do not like the command line... or you use MS Windows)
    
The bottom line is: won't speak of Python o.O

## 3. Version control clients

1. RabbitVCS on Linus
2. Tortoise on MS Windows
3. on MacOSX ?
