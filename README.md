# Version Control: git&github (and SVN and a bit of Mercurial)

We organized this Python programming code talk in three parts:
1. Spicy introduction on version control 
2. How to use git with github (what's github?!)
3. Version control clients (if you do not like the command line... or you use MS Windows)
    
The bottom line is: won't speak of Python o.O

## 3. Version control clients

1. RabbitVCS on Linux
2. Tortoise on MS Windows
3. on MacOSX ?

See `VCS_client.pdf` file for a super short presentation.
